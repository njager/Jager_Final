# Jager_Final
Final project for IU's MSCH-G300 Game Production class taught by Ian Sundstrom.

This game is based off of the following tutorial: https://gamedevacademy.org/unity-puzzle-game-tutorial/

The tutorial was modified by the following 
    +adding two completely new levels
    +adding multiple animations to one level
    +making the nav mesh link transition more smooth
    +changing out all the models
    +adding in sound assets
    +adding in particle effects
    +changing color of platforms and background. A whole new material could not be added because it ruined the illusion
    +adding in a menu that loads levels

Get your penguin from nest to tasty fish by traversing and deciphering eye bending visual illusions.
